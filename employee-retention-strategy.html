                            <p>But before we get into the nitty-gritty of remote employee retention strategies, let’s
                                talk about the elephant in the room:</p>
                            <br>
                            <i>Why do employees leave?</i>
                            <br>
                            <p>There’s a couple of <a href="">obvious reasons</a> why someone would leave a company: low
                                pay, negative relationships with their colleagues, looking for a new challenge, wanting
                                to be a part of a different work culture.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>But then there’s the reasons we seem to neglect:</p>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="">12%</a>of workers seek a better work-life balance</li>
                                <li><a href="">24%</a>wish they received more recognition for their work</li>
                                <li><a href="">8 out of 10 people</a> will start looking for a new job after
                                    experiencing one single bad day at their current workplace</li>
                                <li><a href="">Burnout</a> is making individuals 2.3 times for likely to look for new

                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <b>Remote employee retention strategies aren’t costly and will help you fix all of the
                                issues above. Here’s how.</b>

                            <br><br><br>

                            <h2>Get your team members involved in projects that will help them shine</h2>
                            <br>
                            <p>Learning and development is constantly being referenced as a primary factor to consider
                                when getting and keeping a job. Give your employees a solid role within your company so
                                they won’t hide behind projects they'll never get public credit for. <br> Putting them
                                face-to-face with a chance to actively contribute to the company’s success keeps them
                                accountable and more engaged.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This can be done in many ways:</p>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The <a href="">Atlassian team has a blog</a> for their developers where team members
                                    can showcase their knowledge</li>
                                <li>Adobe gets their team involved in their <a href="">YouTube channel</a> </li>
                                <li>The Google search team alternates between hosting <a href="">videos and live Q&A
                                        sessions</a></li>
                                <li>HubSpot's team members help as instructors for their <a href="">Academy courses</a>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br><br><br>

                            <h2>Offer tailored benefits</h2>
                            <p>We’ve previously gone over some of the fun perks companies offer to stand out in an
                                increasingly competitive talent market. <br> But where do organizations go wrong?</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>A few mistakes companies make when providing employee benefits are:</p>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Failing to customize them to every employee’s need</li>
                                <li>Purchasing benefits that work for your current culture but omitting unconventional
                                    options</li>
                                <li>Forgetting to ask employees for their feedback or using enough data before making a
                                    purchase</li>
                                <li>Not communicating and promoting the benefit packages to your team</li>
                                <li>Replacing expensive, mandatory benefits with cheaper ones employees might not like
                                </li>
                                <li>Not keeping track of the performance of these benefits</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>Remote employee benefits aren’t a one-size-fits-all and they certainly aren’t created

                            <p>Another one of the leading duties of a manager is to be a mentor. Starting a mentorship

                            <h2>Show constant recognition for an employee’s achievements, no matter how small</h2>

                            <p>
                                To ensure the effectiveness of employee retention strategies you’ll naturally have to
                                focus on the core problems too. Showing recognition is a good place to start.
                                <br>
                                But don’t just thank your remote team after huge achievements. Recognition comes in
                                multiple forms that span across an employee’s entire lifecycle with your company. 
                                <br>
                                You can show your appreciation by accommodating work schedules and environments to every
                                person, letting your team choose between remote-hybrid-office work attendance, or
                                catering to their professional development needs. Also, ensure your employee recognition
                                programs align with your company’s values and promises to new recruits. For example, if
                                you boasted your reskilling and wellness strategies, focus your main efforts there.
                                These are two of the <a href="">trending HR highlights</a> to keep an eye on in the upcoming years for
                                a good reason: they keep people happy and ensure they enjoy working for your company,
                                limiting the chance of them leaving.
                            </p>

                            <p>Finally, remember to regularly check in on sentiment with your employees, whether that’s through one-on-ones or engagement surveys. This helps you adapt the strategies you use to reduce employee absenteeism and enhance employee retention for good. </p>
